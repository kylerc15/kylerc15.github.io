            <h4>Winter Trouble</h4>
            <p id="author">by Christopher Smith</p>
            <p id='artText'>
                The same system that brought snow and ice to Texas over the holiday weekend will spread more wintry trouble across the Mississippi Valley, South and eventually the Northeast over the next several days.
                Snow and sleet are falling from Arkansas and parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley all the way through the Midwest, northern Appalachians and into the interior Northeast. Meanwhile, heavy rain and thunderstorms are rolling across northern Florida.
                Over the next 12 to 24 hours, a low pressure system strengthening along the Gulf Coast will race northeastward. It will move across Upper Ohio Valley and the central Appalachians early Tuesday and into the Northeast by early Wednesday. 
                This system will tap the Gulf of Mexico and produce heavy rain and thunderstorms across the Southeast and northern Florida tonight. A few of the thunderstorms, especially the ones that roll across northern Florida later today, could produce gusty winds and an isolated. A Tornado Watch has been issued for the northern Florida and southern Georgia including Gainesville and Jacksonville, Fla., and Valdosta, Ga.
                The rain and thunderstorm chances move into the Carolinas and coastal Mid-Atlantic early Tuesday.
                Across its northern and western flanks, cold, arctic air will be entrenched in the system, producing snow from the Ozarks, Middle Mississippi and Lower Ohio valleys into the interior Northeast. Additional snowfall accumulations will range from a couple inches across the Middle Mississippi Valley to up to a foot across the Ohio Valley and high elevations of the Northeast and New England.
                The most dangerous and treacherous weather will occur between the Tennessee Valley, eastern and central Kentucky, Ohio Valley and central Appalachians. Here, freezing rain ranging from a quarter to half inch will glaze roads, trees, and powerline. This will make travel nearly impossible while causing power outages.
                The ice threat should then shift into eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, and across parts of interior southern New England early Tuesday. Cities like Reading and Allentown, Pa., to Hartford, Conn., and Springfield to Worcester, Mass., could be scraping away a tenth to quarter inch of ice accretion and a few inches of snow on Tuesday.
                Winter Storm Warnings are in effect from Arkansas to Maine. This includes the Middle Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio valleys, eastern Great Lakes, Upstate New York and the northern mountains of New England.
                Ice Storm Warnings have been posted from eastern Kentucky,southeastern Ohio, and western West Virginia to  Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Lehigh Valley and adjacent northwestern New Jersey.
                With a wintry mess likely over the next several days, it is a good idea to check for road closures ahead of time and plan for delays and extra time. It is also a good idea to keep a snow emergency kit in your vehicle. This should consist of blankets, water, non-perishable food, jumper cables, mittens, a flashlight as well as an extra cell phone charger.
