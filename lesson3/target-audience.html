                are grown up and moved out. He runs the farm with his wife. He likes to look ahead for the upcoming weather
                so he can know how to treat his farm to get the best potatoes that he can for his buyers. He also needs to know
                because he is close to retirement. His body is getting worn out from all the years of farming. He needs to prepare
                himself for bad weather, or know if he just can't go out at all.

        <h5>Gardner Sally Sherman</h5>
            <p>Sally gardens different types of fruits and vegetables. She has her own business where she sells her products
            for extra money. Her husband makes plenty of money so its more for her own pleasure. She has 4 young children,
            The oldest two are 10 and 12. She wants to teach them her gardening skills so that they can help her and maybe
            even do it on their own one day. The poeople of her Idaho love her products and she is becoming more and more popular.
            She needs to know the weather because if it is too cold or too hot she just won't take her kids out or maybe even
            stay home herself.
